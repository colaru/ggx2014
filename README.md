# Groovy and Grails eXchange 2014

This is the demo project for my talk [Grails and the real-time world](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1957-groovy-grails-exchange-2014#program) from GGX 2014.

The project repo has the following tags:

- photo: Demo integrating with the filesystem without pain and pushing pictures to browsers in real time using Websockets. Note that you have to configure the path for the generated photos in [Config.groovy](https://github.com/lmivan/ggx2014/blob/master/grails-app/conf/Config.groovy#L125) file and also you have to install `image-magick` in your system.
- xmpp: Interact with an XMPP bot to check the weather and the stocks. Note that you have to configure the xmpp connection details in [Config.groovy](https://github.com/lmivan/ggx2014/blob/master/grails-app/conf/Config.groovy#L127) file.

The slides of the talk are available at [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/ilopmar/ggx-2014-grails-and-the-real-time-world).
